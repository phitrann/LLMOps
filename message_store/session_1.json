It combines the power of deep learning with large-scale retrieval systems by incorporating external knowledge from a dataset during the generation process.\n\nIn the RAG approach, an initial sequence is generated using a pretrained language model (like GPT), followed by a retrieval step where relevant documents or passages are fetched from a large corpus based on the context and content of the initial generated text. These retrieved pieces serve as additional information to enrich the final generated output.\n\nThe RAG system significantly improves performance in various natural language tasks, such as document summarization, question answering, text classification, and more by providing access to a vast amount of real-world knowledge that helps produce high-quality, contextually relevant content.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "ai", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": [], "usage_metadata": null}}, {"type": "human", "data": {"content": "What is RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system?", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "human", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false}}, {"type": "ai", "data": {"content": "The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system is a state-of-the-art approach to natural language processing that combines the power of large pre-trained language models with an external knowledge retrieval mechanism. Essentially, RAG enhances the generative capabilities of these models by allowing them to access and incorporate relevant information from external datasets or databases in real-time during text generation tasks.\n\nIn traditional language models, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), they are trained on a fixed dataset comprising diverse contexts and vocabulary. They generate responses based purely on their learned patterns within this limited corpus. However, the RAG system allows these models to access additional information beyond their training data during the text generation process.\n\nThe RAG architecture typically consists of three main components: a pre-trained language model (such as BERT or GPT), an external knowledge retrieval mechanism that fetches relevant documents from a database, and a fusion module responsible for integrating this retrieved information with the generated content. The retriever may use various techniques to identify the most appropriate document(s) based on contextual relevance.\n\nThe RAG system offers several advantages over traditional language models: it can generate more accurate, detailed, and coherent outputs by drawing from external knowledge sources; its capacity for handling complex tasks in domains such as news generation, question answering, and even scientific research is improved due to its ability to access relevant information on-demand.\n\nIn summary, the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system represents a significant advancement in natural language processing by combining state-of-the-art generative models with an external knowledge retrieval mechanism for augmenting text generation capabilities.

Prepare the noodles: Soak rice noodles in warm water until they are soft but not mushy. Then drain them well.\n\n2. Cook the meat mixture: In a large pot or wok, cook ground pork/beef with onion and seasoning (fish sauce, salt, sugar, black pepper) over medium heat until it's browned and fully cooked.\n\n3. Prepare egg wrapping: Hard boil eggs in water for 8-10 minutes then peel them. Gently separate the egg whites from yolks without breaking the yolk (for an authentic look).\n\n4. Assemble the Mi Quang dish: Place a portion of cooked noodles at the bottom of a serving plate or bowl, add some meat mixture on top, then wrap each egg with a piece of noodle and place it beside the meat. Add sliced bok choy or other vegetables around the platter.\n\n5. Serve: Gently wet rice paper by lightly dampening your hands in water, lay it flat, and add some seasoning before carefully wrapping a portion of noodles, vegetables, and meat to create small rolls or parcels. Serve hot with additional dipping sauce (made from lime juice, fish sauce, sugar, chili flakes).\n\nEnjoy your homemade Vietnamese Mi Quang!
